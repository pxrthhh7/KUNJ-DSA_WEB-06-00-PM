// Q.1) What is "Bubble Sort", and how does it work ?

// Ans > Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that sorts a list of numbers by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order.
//       that starts from the first element of an array and compares it with the second element. If the first element is greater than the second,
//       we swap them. It continues this process until the end of the array, with the largest elements “bubbling” to the top.


// Q.2) Explain the "time complexity" of Bubble Sort in the best, worst, and average cases. 

// Ans >       















// Q.3) What is the **space complexity** of Bubble Sort ?

// Q.4) Why is Bubble Sort not the most efficient sorting algorithm ?  

// Q.5) How can we optimize Bubble Sort ?
